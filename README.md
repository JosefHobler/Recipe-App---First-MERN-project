My first project with MERN stack (Mongo DB, Express, React, Node.js)

How to run the program: 1) Fork
                        2) Clone
                        3) MongoDBCompass has to be installed in order to run the project on localhost as it's not fully completed project
                        4) In server subdirectory run command: npm run dev
                        5) In client subdirectory run command: npm start
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
                        
 TODO: 1) Write tests
       2) Design including: fonts, color pallete, images, layouts,...)  
       3) Get some animations in place
